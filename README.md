# Azure Seller Assistant

AI-powered Azure pricing solution using Microsoft Agent Framework with multi-agent workflow for requirements gathering, BOM generation, pricing calculation, and proposal creation.

## Architecture

The solution uses a two-stage orchestration pattern:

1. **Discovery Stage**: Interactive chat with the Question Agent to gather requirements
2. **Processing Stage**: Sequential workflow executing BOM → Pricing → Proposal agents

### Agents

| Agent | Tools | Purpose |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Question Agent** | Microsoft Learn MCP | Gathers requirements through adaptive Q&A (max 20 turns) |
| **BOM Agent** | Microsoft Learn MCP | Maps requirements to Azure services and SKUs |
| **Pricing Agent** | Azure Retail Prices API | Calculates real-time costs for each BOM item |
| **Proposal Agent** | None | Generates professional Markdown proposal |

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
- Azure AI Foundry project with deployed model (e.g., gpt-4o-mini)

## Setup

1. **Clone repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd azure-seller-assistant
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and set:
   - `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`: Your Azure AI Foundry project endpoint
   - `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`: Your deployed model name (default: gpt-4o-mini)

5. **Authenticate with Azure**
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

6. **Optional - Start Aspire Dashboard for Observability**
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it -p 18888:18888 -p 4317:18889 --name aspire-dashboard mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:latest
   ```
   Access the dashboard at http://localhost:18888 to view OpenTelemetry traces.

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will:
1. Start an interactive chat session to gather your Azure requirements
2. Ask adaptive questions about workload type, scale, services, and region
3. Generate a Bill of Materials (BOM) based on your requirements
4. Calculate real-time pricing using the Azure Retail Prices API
5. Create a professional proposal document

### Example Interaction

```
=== Starting Requirements Gathering ===

Agent: Hello! I'm here to help you design and price an Azure solution. Let's start by 
understanding your needs.

What type of workload are you looking to run on Azure? For example:
- Web application
- Database
- Data analytics
- Machine learning
- IoT solution

You: Web application for e-commerce

Agent: Great! An e-commerce web application. To help size the solution appropriately, 
could you tell me about your expected scale? For example:
- How many concurrent users do you expect?
- What's your expected daily traffic?

You: About 5000 daily users

Agent: For an e-commerce application with 5000 daily users, you'll need a reliable 
web hosting solution and database. Do you have any specific Azure services in mind, 
or would you like me to recommend appropriate services?

You: Please recommend services

Agent: Which Azure region would you prefer for deployment?

You: East US

Agent: Based on our conversation, here's a summary of your requirements:

**Requirements Summary:**
- **Workload Type**: E-commerce web application
- **Expected Scale**: ~5,000 daily users
- **Recommended Services**: Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database
- **Deployment Region**: East US

We are DONE!

✅ Requirements gathering complete!

# Azure Solution Proposal

## Executive Summary
Based on your requirements for an e-commerce web application serving approximately 
5,000 daily users, we recommend a solution built on Azure App Service and Azure SQL 
Database deployed in the East US region...

## Cost Breakdown
| Service | SKU | Quantity | Hourly Rate | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-----|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Azure App Service | P1v2 | 1 | $0.10 | $73.00 |
| Azure SQL Database | S1 | 1 | $0.03 | $21.90 |

**Total Monthly Cost**: $94.90
**Total Annual Cost**: $1,138.80

## Troubleshooting

**Error: AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT not set**
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your Azure AI Foundry endpoint

**Authentication errors**
- Run `az login` to authenticate with Azure CLI
- Verify you have access to the Azure AI Foundry project

**Import errors**
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Async generator cleanup errors on shutdown**
- These are harmless warnings from the MCP client during program shutdown
- The application includes a custom exception handler to suppress these

**Pricing returns $0.00**
- The Azure Retail Prices API may not have pricing data for all SKU/region combinations
- Verify the service name and SKU match Azure's naming conventions
- Check the API filter parameters in `src/utils/pricing_api.py`
