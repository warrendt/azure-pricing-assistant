## Tasks

### ✅ Task 2.1: Enhance Question Agent with Smart Prompting

- [ ] Update `question_agent.py` with Phase 2 instructions from `specs/phase2/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- [ ] Copy enhanced instructions EXACTLY (do not paraphrase)
- [ ] Verify instruction includes intelligent question flow:
  - [ ] First: Workload type (web, database, analytics, ML, etc.)
  - [ ] Second: Scale requirements (users, requests, data volume)
  - [ ] Third: Specific Azure services or recommendations
  - [ ] Fourth: Deployment region
  - [ ] Optional: Special requirements (HA, compliance)
- [ ] Ensure minimum completion criteria documented:
  - [ ] Workload type + at least one service + region
- [ ] Verify "We are DONE!" instruction preserved
- [ ] Test with various workload scenarios:
  - [ ] Web application
  - [ ] Database workload
  - [ ] Analytics workload
  - [ ] Multi-service scenario

---

### ✅ Task 2.2: Build BOM Agent with JSON Parsing

- [ ] Update `bom_agent.py` with Phase 2 instructions from `specs/phase2/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- [ ] Copy JSON schema template exactly
- [ ] Verify service-to-SKU mapping guidance included
- [ ] Verify default `hours_per_month: 730` instruction
- [ ] Implement JSON extraction logic:
  - [ ] Handle markdown code blocks (```json ... ```)
  - [ ] Parse JSON array with `json.loads()`
  - [ ] Validate required fields:
    - [ ] serviceName
    - [ ] sku
    - [ ] quantity
    - [ ] region
    - [ ] armRegionName
    - [ ] hours_per_month
- [ ] Add error handling:
  - [ ] Invalid JSON → log error, request retry
  - [ ] Missing fields → validation error
  - [ ] Malformed structure → graceful failure
- [ ] Test with various requirement scenarios:
  - [ ] Simple web app → App Service
  - [ ] Database → SQL Database
  - [ ] Multi-service → App Service + SQL + Storage

---

### ✅ Task 2.3: Create Azure Pricing API Tool

- [ ] Create `src/utils/pricing_api.py`
- [ ] Implement `get_azure_price(service_name: str, sku_name: str, region: str) -> float`:
  - [ ] Import `requests` library
  - [ ] Define endpoint: `https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices`
  - [ ] Construct OData filter:
    ```python
    f"serviceName eq '{service}' and skuName eq '{sku}' and armRegionName eq '{region}'"
    ```
  - [ ] Make HTTP GET request with params
  - [ ] Parse JSON response
  - [ ] Extract `retailPrice` from `Items[0]`
  - [ ] Return price as float
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling:
  - [ ] No results found → return 0.0, log warning
  - [ ] HTTP timeout → retry once with exponential backoff
  - [ ] Invalid response → return 0.0, log error
  - [ ] API error codes (400, 429, 500) → handle appropriately
- [ ] Test with real API calls:
  - [ ] Virtual Machines / Standard_D2s_v3 / eastus
  - [ ] Azure App Service / P1v2 / eastus
  - [ ] SQL Database / S1 / eastus
- [ ] Document API response format in docstring

---

### ✅ Task 2.4: Implement Pricing Agent with Tool Calling

- [ ] Update `pricing_agent.py` with Phase 2 instructions from `specs/phase2/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- [ ] Import `get_azure_price` from `src.utils.pricing_api`
- [ ] Register as FunctionTool:
  ```python
  from agent_framework import FunctionTool
  
  pricing_tool = FunctionTool(
      name="get_azure_price",
      description="Get Azure retail pricing",
      func=get_azure_price
  )
  ```
- [ ] Add tool to agent creation:
  ```python
  pricing_agent = await client.create_agent(
      name="pricing_agent",
      instructions="...",
      tools=[pricing_tool]
  )
  ```
- [ ] Verify instructions include:
  - [ ] Parse BOM JSON from previous agent
  - [ ] Call get_azure_price for each item
  - [ ] Calculate: monthly_cost = retailPrice × quantity × hours_per_month
  - [ ] Sum all costs for total
  - [ ] Format as JSON output
- [ ] Test tool calling:
  - [ ] Verify agent calls tool correctly
  - [ ] Check calculations are accurate
  - [ ] Validate JSON output format
- [ ] Test error scenarios:
  - [ ] API returns 0.0 → verify note added
  - [ ] Invalid BOM JSON → verify graceful handling

---

### ✅ Task 2.5: Enhance Proposal Agent Document Generation

- [ ] Update `proposal_agent.py` with Phase 2 instructions from `specs/phase2/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- [ ] Copy template structure exactly
- [ ] Verify all required sections included:
  - [ ] Executive Summary (2-3 paragraphs)
  - [ ] Solution Architecture (service list)
  - [ ] Cost Breakdown (markdown table)
  - [ ] Total Cost Summary (monthly + annual)
  - [ ] Next Steps (deployment recommendations)
  - [ ] Assumptions (operating hours, region, pricing)
- [ ] Verify markdown formatting requirements:
  - [ ] Proper headers (# ## ###)
  - [ ] Tables for cost breakdown
  - [ ] Bullet points for lists
- [ ] Test proposal generation:
  - [ ] Simple single-service solution
  - [ ] Multi-service solution
  - [ ] Verify all data included from conversation
- [ ] Validate professional tone and completeness
- [ ] Check client-ready quality

### ✅ Task 2.6: End-to-End Integration Testing

- [ ] Configure environment:
  - [ ] Create `.env` with Azure AI Foundry credentials
  - [ ] Run `az login` to authenticate
  - [ ] Verify AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT set
  - [ ] Verify AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME set
- [ ] **Test Scenario 1: Simple Web Application**
  - [ ] Start: "I need help pricing a web app"
  - [ ] Verify Question Agent asks intelligent questions
  - [ ] Provide: "10,000 users per day, East US region"
  - [ ] Confirm "We are DONE!" terminates properly
  - [ ] Validate BOM JSON:
    - [ ] Contains Azure App Service
    - [ ] Appropriate SKU selected (Standard or Premium)
    - [ ] Correct region mapping
  - [ ] Check Pricing Agent:
    - [ ] Calls real Azure Retail Prices API
    - [ ] Returns valid pricing data
    - [ ] Calculations correct
  - [ ] Review final proposal:
    - [ ] All sections present
    - [ ] Professional formatting
    - [ ] Accurate cost data
- [ ] **Test Scenario 2: Database Workload**
  - [ ] Start: "I need a database solution"
  - [ ] Verify adaptive questioning
  - [ ] Validate SQL Database or Cosmos DB selected
  - [ ] Check pricing accuracy
- [ ] **Test Scenario 3: Multi-Service Solution**
  - [ ] Start: "Web app with database and storage"
  - [ ] Verify BOM includes all 3 services
  - [ ] Check pricing for each service
  - [ ] Validate total cost calculation
- [ ] **Test Edge Cases**:
  - [ ] Unknown SKU → verify fallback pricing ($0 with note)
  - [ ] Invalid region → verify error handling
  - [ ] API timeout → verify retry logic works
  - [ ] API returns empty results → verify $0 fallback
- [ ] Document test results:
  - [ ] Create example outputs for each scenario
  - [ ] Note any issues or unexpected behavior
  - [ ] Record API response times
  - [ ] Document pricing accuracy
